👋 Welcome to Physicalguards’ GitHub!

🏠 About the Project: Physical Guards

Physical Guards is an innovative research project that focuses on physical-based security solutions for smart homes using AI. Developed as part of the European Master Team Project at the University of Mannheim, this project aims to leverage AI and sensor technologies to enhance the safety and security of smart home environments.

🌟 Key Objectives

    •	Advanced Security for Smart Homes: Developing a security framework that detects and responds to physical threats using AI-driven analysis of sensor data.
    •	Integration of AI: Utilizing machine learning algorithms to process data from physical sensors, improving the detection of anomalies and potential intrusions.
    •	Proactive Safety Measures: Ensuring that smart homes can autonomously identify threats and take preemptive actions to protect the residents and property.

🔧 Project Features

    •	AI-Powered Threat Detection: Machine learning models designed to interpret sensor data and recognize patterns indicative of potential threats.
    •	Real-Time Monitoring: Continuous surveillance capabilities to maintain up-to-date security insights.
    •	Smart Integration: Compatibility with existing smart home technologies for a seamless user experience.

🛠️ Technologies & Tools Used

    •	Programming Languages: Python, JavaScript
    •	Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, OpenCV, Node.js
    •	Hardware Integration: IoT sensors and microcontrollers for data collection and response mechanisms

💡 Future Enhancements

The Physical Guards project plans to expand in the following areas:
• Enhanced Machine Learning Models: Improving the accuracy of detection algorithms with more extensive training data.
• User-Friendly Interfaces: Developing intuitive dashboards for homeowners to manage and review security data.
• Scalability: Extending the system for use in larger smart building contexts.
